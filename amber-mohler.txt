Stretch Questions

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
     You draw a box with two smaller blocks inside. The very inner box is your content. The middle box would be your padding, and the last box would be your border. Everything outside of the box is the margin. When you want to create a section or div, it is important to make sure you calculate all of these numbers together otherwise your spacing will be off.
